## Read for Class

Take a large cup of coffee, drink it, then reflect on [fsm.py](../src/fsm.py). We will talk to this code in class.

Note that [fsm.py](../src/fsm.py) implements a "domain-specific language" (DSL)
for finite state machines (FSM) written in Python.

Optional reading:

- For more on DSLs, see

## Introductory Python


Read chapters one to four of [Think like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)

+ The way of the program
+ Variables, expressions and statements
+ Functions
+ Case study: interface design

Then do:

+ All the exercises 3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4,3.5 
      + In your own directory, have a file called think3.py
+ Exercises 4.2, 4.3: but make sure you first follow the [install instructions](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/install.html).
      + Yes, there is a full worked solution available, but try iut out yourself first.
      + In your directory, add figures `think4\_2.png`, `think4\_3.png` showing screen snaps generated from these figures.
